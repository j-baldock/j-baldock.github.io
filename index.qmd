::: {#hero-heading}
I am an aquatic ecologist with broad interests in population and landscape ecology, ecohydrology, and conservation biology. I use field studies, statistical models, and genetic tools to study the linkages between habitat heterogeneity, life history, and population dynamics of freshwater fishes. I work closely with stakeholders to co-produce science that informs conservation and management under accelerating climate and hydrologic change.
