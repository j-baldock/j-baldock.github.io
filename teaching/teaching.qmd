I am passionate about ecology and conservation, and I aim to share this
enthusiasm through **question-driven, student-guided teaching** and
**flexible, transparent mentorship**. My philosophy centers on meeting
students where they are, fostering curiosity through experiential
learning, and helping them build skills to think critically, ask
meaningful questions, and synthesize knowledge. I adapt my guidance to
the diverse backgrounds, needs, and career goals of my students and
mentees, creating inclusive, supportive environments that encourage
independence, discovery, and a sense of camaraderie in both the
classroom and the field. <br><br>

## Teaching background and approach

As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Wyoming, I delivered
lectures, supervised laboratory projects, and provided feedback on
assignments for more than 20 students. The virtual classroom format
during the COVID-19 pandemic posed both challenges and opportunities. I
sought to meet students where they were at, identify their individual
learning goals, and engage with them not just as a TA, but also as a
friendly face in an uncertain and socially difficult time. Given my own
undergraduate experiences and the value of one-on-one discussions, I
made extra time in my schedule for office hours to ensure that all
students were getting the necessary level of support and type of
instruction. My students have noted that I explain complex topics
clearly, provide helpful feedback on assignments, and am approachable
and enjoyable to meet with.

In addition to regular classroom instruction, I've also contributed to
courses as a guest lecturer, delivering instruction on Bayesian
statistics at the graduate level.

## Mentoring philosophy

I believe flexible, adaptive mentorship is key to student success and
essential for recruiting and retaining individuals from diverse
backgrounds. I have mentored individuals at many career stages, from
undergraduates seeking their first field experience, to advanced
graduate students. Each mentee has required different forms of support,
and I work to recognize these needs and adjust my mentorship approach
accordingly. Regardless of career stage, I aim to support independence
and creativity, while also promoting inclusiveness and camaraderie. My
mentorship philosophy emphasizes team science, where students are
treated as colleagues and collaborators. Above all, I prioritize student
welfare and work to ensure each student gains the skills and confidence
needed to succeed in their chosen career.

## Outreach and engagement

I enjoy organizing and contributing to a wide range of public outreach
and science communication activities. These efforts not only broaden the
impact of my research but also provide students and mentees with
meaningful learning experiences that enrich their work and expand their
career opportunities. For all outreach efforts, I work with my
technicians and mentees to develop workshop materials, challenging them
to translate what they learned in the field to impactful demonstrations
and activities. I've found that providing mentees with outreach and
science communication opportunities can enhance their experience in
field biology and highlight adjacent career paths.
