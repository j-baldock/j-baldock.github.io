    "text": "Data visualization and decision support tools\n\nGroundwater Availability Data Viewer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn riverine ecosystems, groundwater is a key component of hydrologic budgets and groundwater-fed habitats are expected to serve as climate refuges for cold-water fish as groundwater input buffers against stressful water temperatures and hydrologic variability. Yet accurate, spatially continuous estimates of groundwater availability in river systems unavailable, particularly at spatial scales relevant to fisheries habitat management. In a recent paper, we applied machine learning techniques to remotely sense landscape data and field observations of groundwater springs to generate high-resolution, spatially continuous estimates of groundwater availability across the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming. Explore the data visualization tools here.\n\n\n\n\nSTREAM: Simulation Toolkit for River Ecosystem Adaptive Managment\n\n\n Photo credit: Bureau of Reclamation\n\n\nClimate change and hydrologic alteration by dams are reshaping river systems worldwide, threatening freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the sustainability of critical ecosystem services. Environmental flows – allocating water specifically to sustain ecosystems – offer an opportunity to integrate ecosystem needs into water management. However, flow recommendations may need to be reassessed as climate change shifts the environmental context under which recommendations were originally developed.\nSTREAM is a decision support platform that simulates how changing streamflow and temperature influence the productivity of Yellowstone cutthroat trout in the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming. Built for fisheries and water managers and conservation professionals, STREAM integrates long-term environmental and biological data to support adaptive, climate-resilient management strategies. STREAM is currently in beta testing.

As part of my Ph.D., I established an extensive stream temperature monitoring network across the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming, leveraging data collected by the University of Wyoming, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

I was fortunate to have parents that instilled in me a deep appreciation for the outdoors (and fish!) at an early age. The summers of my childhood were ones of camping trips and lazy days along the South Fork Yuba River, where I spent most of my time watching rainbow trout through a mask and snorkel. My brother and I also spent countless days down at the lake with fishing rods and a can of worms, but we never seemed to catch anything."

    "text": "Research Journey\nI started my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2010. I soon found myself in an introductory fisheries class, where I discovered you could actually get paid to study fish. I then got a technician job with Dr. Daniel Schindler, prepping otoliths for microchemical analysis in addition to conducting other lab and field tasks. This position led to a summer field job with the Alaska Salmon Program, where I assisted with research and monitoring of salmon ecosystems in southwest Alaska. I also completed my capstone research during this first summer with ASP, which explored how juvenile coho salmon track shifting mosaics of temperature and food across river floodplains. This work was done in collaboration with Daniel and Jonny Armstrong. During my undergraduate I also participated in two field ecology programs, one at UW’s Friday Harbor Laboratories in Friday Harbor, Washington, and the other with the School for Field Studies in Bocas del Toro, Panama, where I studied ontogenetic habitat shifts in invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish.\nIn 2014, I received a B.Sc. in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. I continued to work for the Alaska Salmon Program for an additional four years, but now as a Field Biologist at ASP’s Chignik Lakes field station. In this role, I maintained long-term monitoring datasets of coastal salmon ecosystems, coordinated research activities with partner agencies, and helped communicate our science to the commercial and subsistence fishing communities. During the winter of 2016, I completed a short stint as a research technician in central Ecuador, where I assisted with a collaborative project investigating how local adaptation shapes climate vulnerability in stream macroinvertebrate communities. These immersive experiences (Alaska, Ecuador, Panama, and Friday Harbor) provided a strong background in field ecology and profoundly shaped my scientific and conservation ethos.\nI moved to Laramie, Wyoming, in 2018 to pursue a graduate degree with Dr. Annika Walters in the USGS Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at the University of Wyoming. I started as a Master’s student investigating the spawning ecology of Yellowstone cutthroat trout in groundwater-fed tributaries to the Snake River near Jackson, Wyoming. I soon bypassed to the PhD track and expanded my research to explore the effect of groundwater on recruitment dynamics and population diversity across the river network. During this time, I got involved with the WyACT project and led efforts to quantify the effects of changing climate and water management on trout population dynamics.\nI recently completed an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. My research at USGS used data from distributed sensor networks to understand fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in streamflow and temperature, how spatial patterns change with interannual variability in drought conditions, and the effects of this dynamic heterogeneity on fish population demography and climate vulnerability. Drs. Jenn Fair, Ben Letcher, Clint Muhlfeld, Robert Al-Chokhachy, and Jason Dunham were (and still are) key collaborators on this work.\nMy research journey has come full circle. I am back working with Jonny Armstrong as a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State University. My research seeks to understand how the “growth regime” can be used as a framework to prioritize habitat connectivity decisions at the regional scale. A key component of this work involves developing a theoretical model to understand the value of migratory life histories to population dynamics for coldwater fish. Dr. Tim Cline at Montana State University, Drs. Helen Neville, Dan Dauwalter, and Emma Lundberg at Trout Unlimited, and Dr. Seth Wenger at University of Georgia are key collaborators on this work."
