I'm an ORISE postdoctoral research fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey's [Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock) and [Eastern Ecological Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc), advised primarily by Drs. [Jenn Fair](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jenn-fair) and [Ben Letcher](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/benjamin-h-letcher). I received a Ph.D. in [Ecology and Evolution](https://www.uwyo.edu/uwgrad/interdisciplinary-programs/pie/index.html) from the University of Wyoming in 2024, advised by Dr. Annika Walters in the [USGS Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://wyocoopunit.org/). I also hold a B.Sc. in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences from the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington.

I'm an aquatic ecologist with broad interests in population, evolutionary, and landscape ecology, ecohydrology, and conservation biology. I use field, quantitative, and genetic tools to study the linkages between habitat heterogeneity, life history, and metapopulation dynamics of freshwater fishes. Ultimately, I aim to conduct research that informs management strategies for species and landscapes of conservation concern.
