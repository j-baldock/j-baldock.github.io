I am passionate about **open science** and making my research and data as **transparent and accessible** as possible. 

As much of my work is applied, I am increasingly interested in developing and contributing to **data visualization and decision-support tools** to increase the accessibility of my research and inform decision-making for conservation and management. 

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for my statistical computing and [GitHub](https://github.com/j-baldock) for version control. I publish almost all of my projects to websites using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), which I find incredibly effective for **organizing my workflow and collaborating** with other scientists. See below for a list of these sites.

## Data visualization and decision support tools

### Groundwater Availability Data Viewer

In riverine ecosystems, groundwater is a key component of hydrologic budgets and groundwater-fed habitats are expected to serve as climate refuges for cold-water fish as groundwater input buffers against stressful water temperatures and hydrologic variability. Yet accurate, spatially continuous estimates of groundwater availability in river systems unavailable, particularly at spatial scales relevant to fisheries habitat management. In a recent paper, we applied machine learning techniques to remotely sense landscape data and field observations of groundwater springs to generate high-resolution, spatially continuous estimates of groundwater availability across the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming.

Climate change and hydrologic alteration by dams are reshaping river systems worldwide, threatening freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the sustainability of critical ecosystem services. Environmental flows – allocating water specifically to sustain ecosystems – offer an opportunity to integrate ecosystem needs into water management. However, flow recommendations may need to be reassessed as climate change shifts the environmental context under which recommendations were originally developed. 

STREAM is a decision support platform that simulates how changing streamflow and temperature influence the productivity of Yellowstone cutthroat trout in the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming. Built for fisheries and water managers and conservation professionals, STREAM integrates long-term environmental and biological data to support adaptive, climate-resilient management strategies. *STREAM is currently in beta testing*.

Temperature is a "master variable" in aquatic ecosystems, influencing everything from water quality to the distribution of aquatic organisms. As part of my Ph.D., I established an extensive stream temperature monitoring network across the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming, leveraging data collected by the University of Wyoming, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Wyoming Game and Fish Department. This sensor network is maintained by the University of Wyoming.
