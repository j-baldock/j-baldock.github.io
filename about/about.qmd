<div class="h1">Jeff Baldock, PhD - Aquatic Ecologist</div>

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Sciences](https://fwcs.oregonstate.edu/) at Oregon State University, advised by Dr. [Jonathan Armstrong](https://jbarmstrong.wordpress.com). I recently completed an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the U.S. Geological Survey [Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock) and [Eastern Ecological Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc), with Drs. [Jenn Fair](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jenn-fair) and [Ben Letcher](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/benjamin-h-letcher). I received a PhD in [Ecology and Evolution](https://www.uwyo.edu/uwgrad/interdisciplinary-programs/pie/index.html) from the University of Wyoming in 2024, advised by Dr. [Annika Walters](https://wyocoopunit.org/) in the USGS Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. I also hold a BSc from the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. Learn more about my background and research journey, below.

My current research seeks to understand how coldwater fish move and migrate to exploit spatiotemporal habitat heterogeneity across river networks, the value of migratory life histories to population-level processes, and how these concepts can be used as a framework to prioritize habitat restoration at regional scales.

## Background

I grew up in Nevada City, California, located in the foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada mountains. I was fortunate to have parents that instilled in me a deep appreciation for the outdoors (and fish!) at an early age. The summers of my childhood were ones of camping trips and lazy days along the South Fork Yuba River, where I spent most of my time watching rainbow trout through a mask and snorkel. My brother and I also spent countless days down at the lake with fishing rods and a can of worms, but we never seemed to catch anything.

## Research Journey

I started my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2010. I soon found myself in an introductory fisheries class, where I discovered you could actually get paid to study fish. I then got a technician job with Dr. [Daniel Schindler](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/daniel-schindler/), prepping otoliths for microchemical analysis in addition to conducting other lab and field tasks. This position led to a summer field job with the [Alaska Salmon Program](https://alaskasalmonprogram.org/), where I assisted with research and monitoring of salmon ecosystems in southwest Alaska. I also completed my capstone research during this first summer with ASP, which explored how juvenile coho salmon track shifting mosaics of temperature and food across river floodplains. This work was done in collaboration with Daniel and Jonny Armstrong. During my undergraduate I also participated in two field ecology programs, one at UW's Friday Harbor Laboratories in Friday Harbor, Washington, and the other with the [School for Field Studies](https://fieldstudies.org/) in Bocas del Toro, Panama, where I studied ontogenetic habitat shifts in invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish.

In 2014, I received a B.Sc. in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences from the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. I continued to work for the Alaska Salmon Program for an additional four years, but now as a Field Biologist at ASP's Chignik Lakes field station. In this role, I maintained long-term monitoring datasets of coastal salmon ecosystems, coordinated research activities with partner agencies, and helped communicate our science to the commercial and subsistence fishing communities. During the winter of 2016, I completed a short stint as a research technician in central Ecuador, where I assisted with a collaborative project investigating how local adaptation shapes climate vulnerability in stream macroinvertebrate communities. These immersive experiences (Alaska, Ecuador, Panama, and Friday Harbor) provided a strong background in field ecology and profoundly shaped my scientific and conservation ethos.

I moved to Laramie, Wyoming, in 2018 to pursue a graduate degree with Dr. [Annika Walters](https://wyocoopunit.org/) in the USGS Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at the University of Wyoming. I started as a Master's student investigating the spawning ecology of Yellowstone cutthroat trout in groundwater-fed tributaries to the Snake River near Jackson, Wyoming. I soon bypassed to the PhD track and expanded my research to explore the effect of groundwater on recruitment dynamics and population diversity across the river network. During this time, I got involved with the [WyACT](https://www.uwyo.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/wyact/index.html) project and led efforts to quantify the effects of changing climate and water management on trout population dynamics.

I recently completed an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. My research at USGS used data from distributed sensor networks to understand fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in streamflow and temperature, how spatial patterns change with interannual variability in drought conditions, and the effects of this dynamic heterogeneity on fish population demography and climate vulnerability. Drs. [Jenn Fair](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jenn-fair), [Ben Letcher](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/benjamin-h-letcher), [Clint Muhlfeld](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/clint-muhlfeld), [Robert Al-Chokhachy](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/robert-al-chokhachy), and [Jason Dunham](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jason-b-dunham) were (and still are) key collaborators on this work.

My research journey has come full circle. I am back working with Jonny Armstrong as a Postdoctoral Scholar at Oregon State University. My research seeks to understand how the "growth regime" can be used as a framework to prioritize habitat connectivity decisions at the regional scale. A key component of this work involves developing a theoretical model to understand the value of migratory life histories to population dynamics for coldwater fish. Dr. Tim Cline at Montana State University, Drs. Helen Neville, Dan Dauwalter, and Emma Lundberg at Trout Unlimited, and Dr. Seth Wenger at University of Georgia are key collaborators on this work.  

## For Fun

I enjoy spending time outside and connecting with the natural world. I fully embody the "master of none" approach to outdoor pursuits and can be found rock climbing, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, or fly fishing on any given weekend. I am fortunate that all of these activities are easily accessible from my current home in Bozeman, Montana. If I'm not outside, you can find me strumming a guitar or enjoying a cold beverage on a patio with friends.
